1. Do-While Loop Exercise
Problem:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive number. The program should keep asking the user for a positive number until the user enters a positive number. If the user enters a negative number, the program should print an error message and prompt the user again.

Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter a positive number: ");
            number = scanner.nextInt();

            if (number < 0) {
                System.out.println("Error: Please enter a positive number.");
            }
        } while (number < 0);

        System.out.println("Thank you! You entered a positive number: " + number);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:

The do-while loop ensures that the user is prompted at least once, and it continues to prompt until a positive number is entered.
2. While Loop Exercise
Problem:
Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), for n > 1
Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
public class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;  // Number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence
        int a = 0, b = 1;

        System.out.println("Fibonacci Sequence:");

        int count = 0;
        while (count < n) {
            System.out.print(a + " ");
            int nextTerm = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = nextTerm;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

A while loop is used to print the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms. The sequence starts with a = 0 and b = 1, and subsequent numbers are calculated by adding a and b.
3. For Loop Exercise
Problem:
Write a program that prints a multiplication table for a given number (from 1 to 10). Use a for loop to display the table.

Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultiplicationTable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Multiplication table for " + number + ":");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(number + " x " + i + " = " + (number * i));
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:

A for loop is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10, and for each iteration, it calculates and prints the multiplication result for the given number.
4. Combining Loops
Problem:
Write a program that prints a pattern of stars (*) in the form of a right-angled triangle. The program should ask the user for the number of rows and then print the pattern.

Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StarPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the number of rows: ");
        int rows = scanner.nextInt();

        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:

The outer for loop controls the number of rows, while the inner for loop prints stars (*) for each row.
5. Sum of Even Numbers
Problem:
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a user-specified number (inclusive). Use a for loop to calculate the sum.

Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumEvenNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= number; i += 2) {
            sum += i;
        }

        System.out.println("The sum of even numbers from 1 to " + number + " is: " + sum);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:

The for loop starts at 2 (the first even number) and increments by 2 to only include even numbers. The sum is updated with each even number.
6. Factorial Calculation Using a While Loop
Problem:
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user using a while loop. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (i.e., n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1).

Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        int factorial = 1;
        int i = 1;

        while (i <= number) {
            factorial *= i;
            i++;
        }

        System.out.println("The factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:

The while loop multiplies the numbers from 1 to n to calculate the factorial. The factorial is updated after each iteration.
7. Nested For Loop Exercise
Problem:
Write a program that prints the following pattern using nested for loops:

yaml
Sao chép mã
1
12
123
1234
12345
Answer:
java
Sao chép mã
public class NumberPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rows = 5;  // Number of rows

        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print(j);
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The outer for loop controls the number of rows.
The inner for loop prints the numbers from 1 up to the current row number.
